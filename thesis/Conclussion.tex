%% Briefly motivate your work and its context. 

%% Summarize your work/method and the results (it was X times better than the
%% strongest alternative).

%% Spell out the implications for and the impacts on ”parallel/medical image
%% computing”. Why it is useful and interesting?

%% Keep in mind that the conclusion will be the last the reviewer reads: You
%% want to leave him with a good impression. - Don’t end the conclusion by
%% saying ”My method can’t do that...” but end by stating its importance and
%% impact.

  you are only off by a bit.}{Anonymous}

In this thesis I have presented several different algorithms for constructing
kd-trees.



%% This section is usually combined with the conclusion section described next.

%% State immediate extensions of your work, things you did not have time to do,
%% or related well-known problems.

%% If you state a future work problem that you don’t want others to steal, say
%% you are already working on it or that it is ”almost” in submission elsewhere.

Optimize triangle divide by excluding uninteresting test cases.

Optimize SAH/SSAH

KD/BVH combination trees: still only carry information for one
dimension, but also provide near and far planes, useful for estimating
the advancement of the ray's $t_{min}$.
