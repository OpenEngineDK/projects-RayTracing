% Tabels of nodes and triangled visited. Perhaps some statistics over
% wasted iterations by threads waiting for other threads in the warp
% to finish. The high triangle count pr leaf optimization may be
% related to this and makes using highly optimized splitting plane
% calculations in the lower nodes useless.


% First establish which ray tracer works the best

% Splitting Schemes:

% Profile the time it takes to create the different trees, especially
% the splitting kernels.

% Compare amount of nodes.

% Tree traversal time.

\chapter{Future Work}\label{chp:future}

  weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it
  always increases.}{Norman Augustine}

KD/BVH combination trees: still only carry information for one
dimension, but also provide near and far planes, useful for estimating
advancing the rays $t_{min}$.

Look at stackless raytracers with ropes.

Using Morton Keys for data structure creation.

Photon Mapping. Which simplifies a lot of the kd tree creation by not
requiring splits.

Aila et al.\citebook{Aila2009} has looked at persistent threads to
accelerate raytracing. This could be utilized to accelerate the SAH
calculations of individial nodes.
