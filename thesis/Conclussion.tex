% Tabels of nodes and triangled visited. Perhaps some statistics over
% wasted iterations by threads waiting for other threads in the warp
% to finish. The high triangle count pr leaf optimization may be
% related to this and makes using highly optimized splitting plane
% calculations in the lower nodes useless.


% First establish which ray tracer works the best

Look at stackless raytracers with ropes.

Using Morton Keys for data structure creation.

Photon Mapping. Which simplifies a lot of the kd tree creation by not
requiring splits.
