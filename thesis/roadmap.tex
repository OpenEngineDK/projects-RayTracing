\chapter{Road Map}

\begin{itemize}
\item Create the KD-tree from points on the GPU
\item Visualize the KD-tree (as part of debugging), draw frame around
  splitting plane in color corrosponding to splitting axis.
\item (Possibly) Extend KD-tree to work on triangles (not particularly optimized
  version, just make it work, no dynamic geometry for now)
\item raytrace the triangle KD-tree and map photons
\item visualize photons
\item Create lighting/caustics from photons
\item Dynamic photon mapping (just recalculate everything 'cept geometry)
\end{itemize}

If time allows

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimize raytracing (packets, stack)
\item Optimize photon mapping, create different photon maps for
  indirect illumination and caustucs, only send accustic photons
  toward specular surfaces.
\item Create the screen space grid data structure and sort photons in
  it. Needs to be really fast, since it has to be updated every frame
  (that the camera moves). How to handle final gather with this data
  structure? Plane rendering as proposed in Bent's phd thesis would
  work. Raytracing is probably out.
\end{itemize}
