\section*{Abstract}

% Efficiently create KD trees on the GPU and ray trace them.

% KDtree focus will be on optimizations and the tradeoff between
% spending extra time on the kd-tree instead of ray tracing.

% Previous work in the area has focused on creating optimal KD-trees.

% The goal of this thesis is to explorer the compromises made in order
% to efficiently ray trace dynamic scenes

% Show that to achive raytracing of dynamic scenes, focus should not
% be on creating 'optimal' trees, but instead on creating good trees
% fast.
