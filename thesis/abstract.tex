\section*{Abstract}

This thesis concerns itself with raytracing and doing that efficiently
on wide SIMT\footnote{single instruction, multiple threads}
hardware. It is motivated by the ever increasing interest in
raytracing and global illumination for creating effects in movies, but
also the increased usage of 2D and 3D ray tracing used in modern
computer games.

The thesis present a survey of different techniques for creating
hierarchical ray tracing acceleration structures, specifically
kd-trees, and how to do this efficiently on the wide SIMT hardware. A
ray tracer will be used to test the quality of the differently created
kd-trees. To give a fair comparison of the time spend ray tracing and
time spend creating the tree in a dynamic scene, both generel and SIMT
specific optimizations have been applied to the ray tracer and
kd-tree.

TODO Write something meaningfull in last paragraph

While previous work in the area has focused on creating optimal
acceleration structures, the goal of this thesis is to explorer
compromises made during tree construction in order to efficiently ray
trace dynamic scenes.

% Show that to achive raytracing of dynamic scenes, focus should not
% be on creating 'optimal' trees, but instead on creating good trees
% fast.






% Efficiently create KD trees on the GPU and ray trace them.

% KDtree focus will be on optimizations and the tradeoff between
% spending extra time on the kd-tree instead of ray tracing.
