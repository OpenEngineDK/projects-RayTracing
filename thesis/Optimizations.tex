\chapter{Optimizations}

Use chunks! Creating chunks will save me the trouble of copying the
size of each node back to the cpu.

Unroll the first and/or last step in FinalBoundingBox. Create a
seperat kernel that handles bounding box reductions with blocksize 1,
avoiding special cases when unrolling final

Remove the aabb's from photon upper nodes. The aabb step can be
performed in one kernel and leaf nodes can have their own aabb array
(or calculate the VVH for the first small node when the splitting
planes are being processed)

When doing uncoalesced glabal memory accesses in the child node
creation steps, copy block node info into shared memory access first.
Also when doing pr triangle calculations that require random owner
node info, the owner nodes are placed succesive and their info can be
stored in shared memory first. (Do an overhaul of photon map to
implement this aswell)
