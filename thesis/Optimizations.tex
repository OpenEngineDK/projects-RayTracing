\chapter{Optimizations}

Use chunks! Creating chunks will save me the trouble of copying the
size of each node back to the cpu.

Unroll the first and/or last step in FinalBoundingBox. Create a
seperat kernel that handles bounding box reductions with blocksize 1,
avoiding special cases when unrolling final

Remove the aabb's from photon upper nodes. The aabb step can be
performed in one kernel and leaf nodes can have their own aabb array

When doing uncoalesced glabal memory accesses in the child node
creation steps, copy block node info into shared memory access first.
Also when doing pr triangle calculations that require random owner
node info, the owner nodes are placed succesive and their info can be
stored in shared memory first.

Use the same array for same node children and primitive info. Only
children will actually have valid primitive info and the rest will
simply need to point to their childrne for info.
