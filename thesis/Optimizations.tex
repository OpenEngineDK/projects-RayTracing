\chapter{Optimizations}

Unroll the first and/or last step in FinalBoundingBox. Create a
seperat kernel that handles bounding box reductions with blocksize 1,
avoiding special cases when unrolling final

When doing uncoalesced glabal memory accesses in the child node
creation steps, copy block node info into shared memory access first.
Also when doing pr triangle calculations that require random owner
node info, the owner nodes are placed succesive and their info can be
stored in shared memory first.
