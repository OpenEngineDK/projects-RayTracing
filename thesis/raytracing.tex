\chapter{Ray Tracing}

% Generel ray tracing code.

% Ray triangle intersection, refer to Wald's thesis. Something
% something about projecting triangles onto planes and doing a lot of
% precalculation. Should be faster than MÃ¶ller-Trumbore's method. Lets
% test it :)

\section{Acceleration Techniques}

% KD restart is the simplest

% Packets: 2x2 packets on the CPU for to take advantage of SIMD
% instructions (Wald), larger packets on the GPU (for roped kd-trees)

% short stacks: Implement stacks or perhaps a link to the parent in
% each node. Would save us the hazzle of updating the stacks, which
% could be a waste of time.

% stackless raytracing using ropes. 



% Novel? stack scheme with parent info in nodes and left/right node
% placed next to each other. Removes overhead of creating and
% maintaning short stack. Needs a way to avoid traversing same
% branches (and short stacks isn't a solution!)

\section{Implementation}

% Start with kd restart, simple to get up and running.

% Implement packets and short stack? Talk to trier
