\chapter{Uptaining the Project}

A short demo of the project can be found on
\url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9gecC5woxs} or the root of the accompanying
cd.

This project has been developed in OpenEngine, which is needed to uptain the
source code. The project has been compiled and tested on Max OS X and Ubuntu.

OpenEngine requires Python, CMake, Boost and the version control system Darcs to
be installed on the system. My project additionally requires that SDL, CUDA 3.1
and FreeImage be installed on the system.

OpenEngine can be installed by opening a terminal and running the
command

\terminalCommand{darcs get http://openengine.dk/code/openengine}

This will place the OpenEngine source in a folder named \textit{openengine} in
the current working directory. cd into that directory and execute the commands

\terminalCommand{chmod +x dist.py}

\terminalCommand{chmod +x make.py}

The project and its dependencies can then be installed with the command

\terminalCommand{./dist.py install proj:PhotonMapping}

The project can then be compiled by running 

\terminalCommand{./make.py}

and run with the command

\terminalCommand{./build/PhotonMapping/PhotonMapping}
