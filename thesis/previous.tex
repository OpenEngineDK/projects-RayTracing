\chapter{Previous Work}

% Raytracing work


% KD-tree work


% Photon mapping work

% Data structures

% Previously constructing the KD-tree was most effective on the CPU,
% optimized and fast for multi core CPU's
\citealp{1230129}

% GPU solutions had to use other datastructures such as grids
\citealp{844181}

% or create hybrid GPU/CPU solutions
\citealp{1572783}

% Recent research has made it possible to construct KD-trees
% efficiently on GPGPU's
\citealp{1409079}
