%% Describe and reference previous work that is relevant to your work.

%% The previous work section is mostly descriptive.

%% Address the weaknesses of the previous methods.

%% You should not do a full comparison between your method and previous
%% work here. Leave that for the Results section.

%% You can however distinguish yourself from previous work by saying
%% something like ”In contrast to method X, my method...”, or ”The main
%% difference between my work and X is...”.

% Raytracing work


% Data structures

% Previously constructing the KD-tree was most effective on the CPU,
% optimized and fast for multi core CPU's
\citebook{1230129}

% GPU solutions had to use other datastructures such as grids before
% GPGPU programming.
\citebook{844181}

% or create hybrid GPU/CPU solutions
\citebook{1572783}

% KD-tree work


% Recent research has made it possible to construct KD-trees
% efficiently on GPGPU's
\citebook{1409079}

% Aila has looked at persistent threads to accelerate raytracing. In
% this thesis I will utilize their idea to accelerate the SAH
% calculations of individial nodes.
\citebook{Aila2009}
