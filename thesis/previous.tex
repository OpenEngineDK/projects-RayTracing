% Early ray tracing

Arthur Appel is credited as the being the first to describe the basic
idea of ray casting\citebook{Appel:1968}, using it to solve the hidden
surface problem and to compute shadows in opaque polygonal scenes to
enhance the perseption of depth. Whitted extended the idea of ray
casting into the general recursive ray tracing algorithm still used
today\citebook{Whitted:1979}. If a ray would hit a surface, it could
generate any number of new rays depending on the surface's material
proporties, reflection, refraction or shadow.


% Data structures for acceleration

Since then a lot of time and effort has gone into improving the
performance of ray tracing and several data structures have been
proposed with this in mind. In 1976 Clark was the first to suggest
using \textit{bounding volumes} to perform geometry culling and in
1986 Goldsmith and Salmon extended this idea with an algorithm for
automatically building \textit{bounding volume hierarchies},
\textit{BVH}'s, topdown\citebook{Goldsmith:1987}. Fujimoto, Tanaka and
Iwata introduced the use of \textit{uniform voxel grids} in
1986\citebook{Fujimoto:1986}. Kaplan introduced the use of kd-trees as
a spatial partitioning scheme\citebook{Kaplan:1985}.

% Surface Area Heuristic 

The idea of automatically creating hierarchical acceleration
structures have since been revisited and improved upon countless
times. One of the most important improvements was the introduction of
the \textit{surface area heuristic}, \textit{SAH}, generally
attributed to MacDonald and Booth\citebook{MacDonald:1990}.


% GPU acceleration structures

% Previously constructing the KD-tree was most effective on the CPU,
% optimized and fast for multi core CPU's
\citebook{1230129}

% GPU solutions had to use other datastructures such as grids before
% GPGPU programming.
\citebook{844181}

% or create hybrid GPU/CPU solutions
\citebook{1572783}



% KD-tree work and what we've made differently


% Recent research has made it possible to construct KD-trees
% efficiently on GPGPU's
\citebook{1409079}
