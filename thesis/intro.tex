% Why global illumination vs local illumination used in most rasterizers

% Why use the GPU? Offloading. The CPU can do a lot of other things
% while the GPU crunch away at those KD trees. Om nom nom nom nom....

% Why even use datastructures on the GPU. They work wonders on the CPU
% but for the GPU they might hinder performance (cite KNN paper and
% dataparallism example with 31 threads waiting)

% In this thesis a brute force raytracer will first bebuild and
% compared to a basic raytracer traversing a KD-tree, to blank
% emphasize the importance of datastructures, even on the GPU.

% importance of efficient datastructures, several datastructures have
% been used for raytracing (BVH, kd-trees, octrees, bla bla...) Some
% are good for bla, others blank

% Will focus on KD-trees and base the implementation on the proposed
% algorithm in zhou et al.

% Needs to be able to quickly create the data structure aswell for
% photon mapping with dynamic geometry/lighting.

% Needs to exploit the massively parallel architecture of GPGPU's
% which require oh so many thread

% can be done by parallising evaluating the approximate cost of each
% node

\textit{Surface Area Heuristic}, $SAH$, 

% and creation of nodes at lower tree levels

% Still not easily paralisable, requires lots of reduction kernels,
% which do not utilize the GPU fully. Also individual node splitting
% costs can leave 31 threads in a warp waiting for the last one to
% finish. In this thesis persistent threads will be used to solve this
% issue.

% Raytracing structures on the GPU has been mapped more or less 100%
% from CPU structures. We need to build them for the GPU instead. That
% means rethinking some of the algorithms (like add persistent
% threads.)

% This thesis will explorer different aspects of KD-tree construction,
% how it affects ray tracing performance and how many resources should
% be devoted to KD-tree construction.

% During this I will look at the usefulness of hierachical traversal
% on the GPU, given that a binary data structure is not easy for the
% GPU to handle and breaks coalescence. A brute force raytracer, that
% performs intersection with all triangles, will be used to motivate
% the use of a hierachical datatsructure, even on the GPU.

% The thesis will look at an alternative to triangle splitting, namely
% triangle division, where the triangle is not split by splitting
% planes, but divided onto each side, by simply adjusting it's
% bounding box.

% Lastly the thesis will try to apply Persistent Threads, as described
% in 'hat', to accelerate SAH computations in the KD-tree construction
% phase.
