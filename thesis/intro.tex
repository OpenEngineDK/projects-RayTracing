% Why global illumination vs local illumination used in most rasterizers

% Before photon mapping it was raytracing and radiosity

% introduction of photon mapping in 1996
\citebook{275461}

% Photon mapping is 'rendering' independent. Works both with ray
% tracing and rasterization.


% importance of efficient datastructures, several datastructures have
% been used for raytracing (BVH, kd-trees, octrees, bla bla...) Some
% are good for bla, others blank

% Will focus on KD-trees

% Needs to be able to quickly create the data structure aswell for
% photon mapping with dynamic geometry/lighting.

% Why use the GPU? Offloading? Especially when the time complexity for
% GPU's are worse than for CPU's? The CPU can do a lot of other things
% while the GPU crunch away at those KD trees. Om nom nom nom nom....

% Needs to exploit the massively parallel architecture of GPGPU's
% which require oh so many thread

% can be done by parallising evaluating the approximate cost of each
% node

\textit{Surface Area Heuristic}, $SAH$, 

\textit{Voxel Volume Heuristic}, $VVH$,

% and creation of nodes at lower tree levels
