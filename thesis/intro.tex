% Why global illumination vs local illumination used in most rasterizers

% importance of efficient datastructures, several datastructures have
% been used for raytracing (BVH, kd-trees, octrees, bla bla...) Some
% are good for bla, others blank

% Will focus on KD-trees

% Needs to be able to quickly create the data structure aswell for
% photon mapping with dynamic geometry/lighting.

% Why use the GPU? Offloading? Especially when the time complexity for
% GPU's are worse than for CPU's? The CPU can do a lot of other things
% while the GPU crunch away at those KD trees. Om nom nom nom nom....

% Needs to exploit the massively parallel architecture of GPGPU's
% which require oh so many thread

% can be done by parallising evaluating the approximate cost of each
% node

\textit{Surface Area Heuristic}, $SAH$, 

% and creation of nodes at lower tree levels

% Still not easily paralisable, requires lots of reduction kernels,
% which do not utilize the GPU fully. Also individual node splitting
% costs can leave 31 threads in a warp waiting for the last one to
% finish. In this paper persistent threads will be used to solve this
% issue.
